<p>
These repositories contain code used in public applications by the Department of Municipal Development.
<p>
It is an attempt to be open and transparent in how we build things and to share what we have built with others.
<p>
It also helps us internally as we now have a single source for our code and a way to track changes, keep backups, and provide documentation.</body>
